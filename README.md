## Game Together ##

Game Together is a message board application where people who are passionate about video games can have a place to talk about these things.

## Functions ##
Users can create an account to participate. Users can also create, edit, and delete topics and comments at will.

## Getting Started ##

To run Game Together locally, clone the project by running the following command in your terminal:
> `git@github.com:Joshua-Hughes/GameTogether.git`

Once clones, make your way into the `client` folder and run:
> `npm install`

Which will install the libraries and other dependencies used by Game Together.

## Database/API ##

Open the solution in Visual Studio and click the green play button to run the server side.

THEN!

In the client folder in terminal, run:
> `npm start`

This will run the app in `https://localhost:3000` to view the site in your browser.
Every change made will reload the page. Any errors will show in the console.

## Acknowledgments ##
Thanks to all the friends who struggled on their own code alongside me. It's comforting to have others suffer with you.
